//         Once upon a time, on a way through the old wild west,…

// … a man was given directions to go from one point to another. The directions were "NORTH", "SOUTH", "WEST", "EAST". 
// Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too.
// Going to one direction and coming back the opposite direction is a needless effort. Since this is the wild west, with dreadfull weather and not much water, it's important to save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die of thirst!

// How I crossed the desert the smart way.

// The directions given to the man are, for example, the following (depending on the language):

// ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"].
// or

// { "NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST" };
// or

// [North, South, South, East, West, North, West]
// You can immediatly see that going "NORTH" and then "SOUTH" is not reasonable, better stay to the same place! So the task is to give to the man a simplified version of the plan. A better plan in this case is simply:

// ["WEST"]



// Write a function dirReduc which will take an array of strings and returns an array of strings with the 
//needless directions removed (W<->E or S<->N side by side).

// The Haskell version takes a list of directions with data Direction = North | East | West | South.
// The Clojure version returns nil when the path is reduced to nothing.
// The Rust version takes a slice of enum Direction {NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST}.



//use recursion - reduce all direct opposites "north - south, east-west" untill none are left in the string

function dirReduc(arr){
  // ...
  pairs = {
      NORTH: 'SOUTH',
      SOUTH: 'NORTH',
      EAST: "WEST",
      WEST: "EAST"
  }

  let ReducedDirections = []

  function reduce(directions){
        let newArr = []
    //  console.log(directions)
        let token = true;
        for(let i = 0; i < directions.length; i++){
            if(pairs[directions[i]] === directions[i + 1]){
                i++;
                token = false;
            } else {
                newArr.push(directions[i])
            }
        }
    //console.log(directions)
        if(token === false){
            reduce(newArr)
        } else {
            reducedDirections = directions
        }
    //    
       // return newArr;
  }
  
  reduce(arr)

  return reducedDirections;
  
}


//dirReduc(["NORTH", "EAST", "WEST", "EAST", "WEST"])
// dirReduc(["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"])
console.log(dirReduc(["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"]))
// Test.assertSimilar(dirReduc(["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"]), ["WEST"])
// Test.assertSimilar(dirReduc(["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"]), ["NORTH", "WEST", "SOUTH", "EAST"])
// Test.assertSimilar(dirReduc(["NORTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "EAST", "WEST"]), [])
