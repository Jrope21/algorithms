  Write a function that,
   given a string of text (possibly with punctuation and line-breaks), 
   returns an array of the top-3 most occurring words, in descending order of the number of occurrences.
Assumptions:

A word is a string of letters (A to Z) optionally containing one or more apostrophes (') in ASCII.
 (No need to handle fancy punctuation.)
Matches should be case-insensitive, and the words in the result should be lowercased.
Ties may be broken arbitrarily.
If a text contains fewer than three unique words, then either the top-2 or top-1 words should be returned, 
or an empty array if a text contains no words.`
